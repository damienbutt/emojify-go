# Contributing to emojify-go

Thank you for your interest in contributing to emojify-go! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Go 1.25 or later
-   Git
-   Make (optional but recommended)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1.  Fork the repository on GitHub
2.  Clone your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emojify-go.git
    cd emojify
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    make dev-setup
    ```

4.  Build the project:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

5.  Run tests:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

### Using the Makefile

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify common tasks. Here are some of the most useful commands:

-   `make build`: Build the application.
-   `make test`: Run all tests.
-   `make lint`: Run the linter.
-   `make ci`: Run the full CI pipeline (lin, test, build).
-   `make help`: Show all available commands.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2.  Make your changes following our coding standards.
3.  Add or update tests as necessary.
4.  Ensure all tests pass:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

5.  Run benchmarks to ensure performance:

    ```bash
    make benchmark
    ```

### Code Style

-   Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`).
-   Use `golangci-lint` for linting. The configuration is in `.golangci.yml`.
-   Write clear, descriptive commit messages, following the Conventional Commits specification.
-   Add comments for complex logic.
-   Keep functions focused and small.

### Testing

-   Write unit tests for new functionality.
-   Maintain or improve test coverage.
-   Include benchmarks for performance-critical code.
-   Test edge cases and error conditions.

### Performance Considerations

Emojify is designed to be fast and efficient. When contributing:

-   Profile your changes if they affect performance.
-   Use benchmarks to validate performance improvements.
-   Consider memory allocation patterns.
-   Test with large inputs.

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1.  Push your changes to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2.  Create a pull request on GitHub.
3.  Fill out the pull request template.
4.  Ensure CI checks pass.
5.  Respond to review feedback.

### Pull Request Guidelines

-   Include a clear description of the changes.
-   Reference any related issues.
-   Keep pull requests focused and atomic.
-   Update documentation if necessary.
-   Add tests for new functionality.

## Coding Standards

### Go Style Guide

Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and:

-   Use meaningful variable and function names.
-   Keep line length reasonable (100-120 characters).
-   Group imports logically.
-   Use interfaces for abstraction.
-   Handle errors appropriately.

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This is enforced by `lefthook` using commit hooks.

```
type(scope): description

feat(cli): add --count flag to show emoji statistics
fix(processor): handle edge case with consecutive emojis
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(emoji): add tests for Unicode edge cases
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`

## Adding New Features

### Emoji Mappings

When adding new emoji mappings:

1.  Update `internal/emoji/data.go`.
2.  Ensure the mapping follows existing patterns.
3.  Add comprehensive tests.
4.  Verify Unicode compatibility.
5.  Update documentation if needed.

### CLI Features

For new command-line features:

1.  Update the CLI definition in `cmd/emojify/main.go`.
2.  Add processing logic in `internal/emojify/`.
3.  Include help text and examples.
4.  Add integration tests.
5.  Update the README.

### Performance Optimizations

When optimizing performance:

1.  Profile before and after changes.
2.  Include benchmarks in your tests.
3.  Document the optimization rationale.
4.  Ensure correctness is maintained.
5.  Consider memory vs. speed tradeoffs.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run a specific test
go test -run TestSpecificFunction ./...
```

### Test Categories

-   **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods.
-   **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions.
-   **Benchmark Tests**: Measure performance.
-   **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions.

### Writing Tests

Use the `testify` framework for assertions:

```go
func TestEmojiReplacement(t *testing.T) {
    processor := emojify.NewProcessor()
    result := processor.Process("Hello :grin:")
    assert.Equal(t, "Hello üòÅ", result)
}
```
